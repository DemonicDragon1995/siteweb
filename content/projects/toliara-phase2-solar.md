## SPECIFICATIONS AND SPECIAL FEATURE

The Tulear Project consists of operating an existing 2.90 MW hybridization project at Tulear. 
A subsequent 4MW power extension to this project is under construction and should be commissioned by Q2 2021.

* Plant Capacity: 4 MW
* End of PPA: 2041
* P50 - Yield (kWh/year): 2,167
* P50 - Energy Produced (MWh/year): 8,212

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

To meet the growing demand for electricity consumption in the city of Tulear, JIRAMA, Madagascar's national electricity and water company, has requested the hybridization of various HFO power plants. 

The project will substitute the use of heavy fuel with clean and sustainable energy. The plant extension will cover all or most of the electricity demand during the day. 

## PARTNER

LIDERA GREEN POWER PCC

## PLANNING

The extension will be conducted under the same SPV, Tulear Green Power, owned by Lidera. The project is expected to be commissioned by Q2 2021. 

Energy will be evacuated through the existing HFO Enelec plants; the existing 2.90 MW plant is already connected.

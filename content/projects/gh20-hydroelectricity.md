## SPECIAL FEATURE

The site is very conducive to the construction of a hydroelectric installation with a natural fall from a height of about 45 m.

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

The project aims to supply a region where electricity needs are very important. The population that can be directly served by this development is more than 100,000 people in rural electrification (Tougué Prefecture). Connected to the national grid, more than 400,000 Guinean households will benefit from renewable, clean and sustainable electricity.

This site is of great interest to the Government of the Republic of Guinea to meet its objectives to meet the energy needs and economic and social development of this prefecture.

It is therefore in this development logic that the MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND HYDRAULICS (MEH) of the Republic of Guinea and DÉVELOPPEMENT ÉNERGIE RENOUVELABLE AFRIQUE (DERA) signed on December 8, 2017 a memorandum of understanding allowing the further studies and the establishment of financing for the construction of a hydroelectric facility.

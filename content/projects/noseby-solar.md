## SPECIFICATIONS AND SPECIAL FEATURES
The project consists of the development and construction of a 5MW solar PV plant, with a 3MWh battery storage system, extendable to 10MW PV and 14MWh storage. 
Plant Capacity: 5 + 3 MWh Batteries (Extendable to 10)
Solar Plants Tariff ($/kWh): Day (PV- 90%): 0.10
(0.07 as of year 8)
Night (Batteries-10%): 0.1525
End of PPA: 2041
P50 - Yield (kWh/year): 1,828
P50 - Energy Produced (MWh/year): 9,018

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES
The solar photovoltaic plant project at Nosy Be was proposed by the Government of Madagascar in order to meet the growing demand for electricity of the island.
Since the island receives strong solar radiation throughout the day, the batteries will charge during daylight, and the stocked energy will be used to supply electricity at night. 

## PARTNER
LIDERA GREEN POWER PCC
NOSY BE GREEN POWER

## PLANNING
Electricity produced by the plant will be purchased by the national electricity offtaker, Jirama.

**DÉVELOPPEMENT ÉNERGIE RENOUVELABLE AFRIQUE inc. wins tender offer for Nose By solar project**
In December 2019, DERA Energy won a tender offer for the project and signed a PPA with Jirama and a 20-year Concession Agreement with the Government of Madagascar. Lidera DevCo. subsequently acquired the project from DERA Energy and hence the PPA and concession agreement were transferred to Lidera DevCo.

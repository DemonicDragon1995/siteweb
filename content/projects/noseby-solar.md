**Location**: MADAGASCAR<br>
**Region**: ATSINANANA<br>
**Estimated yield**: 5 MW<br>

## SPECIFICATIONS AND SPECIAL FEATURES
The project consists of the development and construction of a 5MW solar PV plant, with a 3MWh battery storage system, extendable to 10MW PV and 14MWh storage.

* Plant Capacity: 5 + 3 MWh Batteries (Extendable to 10)
* Night (Batteries-10%): 0.1525
* End of PPA: 2041
* P50 - Yield (kWh/year): 1,828
* P50 - Energy Produced (MWh/year): 9,018

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES
The solar photovoltaic plant project at Nosy Be was proposed by the Government of Madagascar in order to meet the growing demand for electricity of the island.

Since the island receives strong solar radiation throughout the day, the batteries will charge during daylight, and the stocked energy will be used to supply electricity at night. 

## PARTNERS

LIDERA GREEN POWER PCC

## PLANNING

Electricity produced by the plant will be purchased by the national electricity offtaker, Jirama.

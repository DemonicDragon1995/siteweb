LIDERA GREEN POWER PCC

## PLANNING

Construction has been completed in 2020 and the site is in operation. Since its commission, an extension has been under construction and should be commissioned by Q3 2021. The extension will consist of a field of PV panels that will add 18 MW to the energy yield for a total of 20 MW produced on site.

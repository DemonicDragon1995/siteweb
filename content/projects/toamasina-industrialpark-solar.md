## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

As part of the Government of Madagascar’s efforts to grant cheaper and cleaner access to electricity to the population, they have requested the hybridization of existing HFO plants.

This has led to the Malile extension project, which consists of a 35.35 MW power extension at the existing 5.65 MW solar plants located at Diego, Mahajanga and Toamasina.

## PARTNER

LIDERA GREEN POWER PCC

## PLANNING

The extension of this project is under construction and should be commissioned by Q3 2021.

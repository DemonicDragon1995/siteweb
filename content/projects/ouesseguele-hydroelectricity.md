**Region** : MIDDLE GUINEA<br>
**Estimated yield** : 33 MW<br>

## SPECIAL FEATURE

The site is atypical in its geomorphology. Two rivers meet at the foot of a natural fall of about 70 m. The future hydroelectric installation will optimize the use of the water of the two rivers in a single production plant.

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

The project aims to supply a region where electricity needs are very important. The population basin that can be directly served by this development is more than 50,000 people in rural electrification (sub-prefecture of Thianguel-Bori). Connected to the national network at LABÉ, more than 600,000 Guinean households will benefit from renewable, clean and sustainable electricity.

This site is therefore of great interest to the Government of the Republic of Guinea to meet its objectives of meeting the energy needs and economic and social development of this sub-prefecture.

It is therefore in this development logic that the MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND HYDRAULICS (MEH) of the Republic of Guinea and DÉVELOPPEMENT ÉNERGIE RENOUVELABLE AFRIQUE (DERA) signed on December 8, 2017 a memorandum of understanding allowing the further studies and the establishment of financing for the construction of a hydroelectric facility.

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

As part of the Government of Madagascar’s efforts to grant cheaper and cleaner access to electricity to the population, they have requested the hybridization of existing HFO plants.

Once the MALILE solar plants located at Diego, Mahajanga and Toamasina were built, the extension project, consisting of a 35.35 MW power extension at the existing 5.65 MW followed suit.

## PARTNER

LIDERA GREEN POWER PCC

## PLANNING

The extension of this project is under construction and should be commissioned by Q3 2021.

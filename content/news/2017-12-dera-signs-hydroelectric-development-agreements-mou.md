Conakry (Guinea) - DEVELOPPEMENT ENERGIE RENOUVELABLE AFRIQUE (DERA) is taking another step towards the development of its portfolio of renewable energy projects in Guinea (Conakry).

Early December 2017, the DERA partners met with the Minister of Energy and Hydraulics (MEH) and the Ministry's executives for the signing of two memoranda of understanding (MOU) for the development of three hydropower projects for a total power of about 80 MW.

Signing these protocols is an important milestone that now allows the DERA team to continue studies and development.

The three sites targeted by the protocols are located in Moyenne Guinée:

1. GH20, in the watershed of the BAFING river (Tougué prefecture);
2. GH10, in the KABA River watershed (Mamou prefecture);
3. GH52, in the TOMINÉ River watershed (Lélouma prefecture).

The DERA team is proud to be the partner of the Guinean Republic for the development of Clean Energy providing sustainable access to electricity for all.

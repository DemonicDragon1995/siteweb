Conakry (Guinea) - The **DÉVELOPPEMENT ÉNERGIE RENOUVELABLE AFRIQUE (DERA) **team, assisted by a technical team of Guinea's National Energy and Electricity Department, recently visited the Fouta Djallon in Middle Guinea (to make a site survey).

The objective of the survey was to consolidate the available general knowledge to confirm the current data on which the next phases of development of the hydroelectric projects in the sub-region will be based.

These sites are of great interest to the Government of the Republic of Guinea in order to meet its objectives in the area of energy sustainability, economic and social development in the region.

DERA is proud to be the partner of the Guinean State for the development of a Clean Energy offering sustainable access to electricity for all.
